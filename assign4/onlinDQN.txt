algo 1 pseudo for online DQN (deep q learning)
1	initialize a DQN q hat(.;phi)
2	for every episode until convergence do
3		reset the environment to get the current state x.
4		for every time slot of the episode until convergence do
5			pick action, a, for current state ,x, using a policy (like epsilon greedy policy for the Q-function given by the current DQN q hat(.;phi))
6			take action a , get reward r and next state x'.
7			compute input X and target y , to train DQN using the sample <x,a,r,x'> and the current DQN q hat (.;phi).
8			Use X and y to update phi of the DQN by taking one gradient descent step based on the current learning rate , alpha
9			set x<-x'.
